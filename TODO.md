- ~~mechanism for adding metadata to index in a separate table~~
	- ~~i.e. size, duration, dimensions, dates etc~~
	- ~~or just rely on pathlib.Path to get values when required?~~
	
- set up ways to turn file index functions into tasks i.e. by
	yielding values as iteration points.
	
- add glob support for searching

- use .format/string.Template placeholders in schema script for adding
metadata columns during creation
